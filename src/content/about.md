## About Me

<span class="newthought">Breaking things is my zen</span> — give me a web / crypto / reverse challenge and I'll disappear for hours. There's something addictive about that moment when everything clicks and the system gives up its secrets.

I'm steadily climbing the CTFtime rankings, though I'll admit I'm better at solving challenges than leading teams.

## What I Do

**Cryptography** — PQC, lattice attacks (LLL), SageMath mostly.

**Reverse Engineering** — Compiled binaries (Rust, Go, C/C++, Objective-C), interpreted languages (Python, Java, C#), malware analysis.

**Web Security** — Application security testing, vulnerability research.

**Java Internals** — Deobfuscators, classloading mechanics, JVM internals, JNI/JVMTI interfaces, bytecode analysis.

**Security Research** — Vulnerability discovery, exploit development, writing papers with LaTeX.
